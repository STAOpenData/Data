Running the script, the following operations are performed:
1) The selected data sample is uploaded;
2) For each segment, a graph containing the relevant ACS, ALs, and skin-marker trajectories is produced;
3) Box-plots of the STA parameters calculated as described in the manuscript are produced;
4) A graph representing the instantaneous marker displacement for all skin markers of each segment is produced.
